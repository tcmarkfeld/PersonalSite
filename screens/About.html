    <h2>ABOUT TIMOTHY MARKFELD</h2>
    <h4>I'm from Chesterfield, Virginia, and I specialize in web development.</h4>
  </div>

    <div class="container main-container">
        <p>I am currently a Senior at the University of Alabama simultaneously pursuing
          my bachelor's and master's degrees in Management Information Systems and will be graduating in May 2023. I'm seeking a job with 
          interests in software development and cybersecurity. </p><br><hr><br>
          <h3 class="about-subtitle-2">Work Experience</h3><br>
          <h5>LabMX Capstone Support | Fall 2022</h5>
          <p>This group consists of 3 employees that are in charge of systems for the capstone and MIS programming. 
            Responsibilities include imaging new machines, supporting capstone teams with hosting applications, managing 
            server/system and databases, and giving authorization to systems to those who need it.</p>
          <h5>Capgemini RISE Program | August 2022</h5>
          <p>I did this program this past August. It was a four day consulting simulation in the Nashville office. I served as a 
            teach lead on a team of four. In three days, I built a working prototype of a delivery app similar to DoorDash. This was
            a good learning experience for working with a new team in a short amount of time and being able to get everything done.
          </p>
          <h5>Corolla Beach Rentals | Summers 2016-2022</h5>
          <p>For the past seven summers, I have worked for Corolla Beach Rentals. I am responsible for leading a team during setup and takedown of
            equipment.  I provide training and development for new hires.  I oversee the reservation systems which includes online, telephone, and 
            in person options.  I lead several operation areas of the company including equipment inventory and repair, as well as supply chain 
            to ensure we are operating at peak performance. Through this job, I have learned a lot about interacting with customers and
            working on/leading a team.
          </p>
          <h5>Corolla Ice Delivery | Summers 2019-2022</h5>
          <p>
            For the past four summers, I have also been the General Manager of Corolla Ice Delivery. I do this simultaneously with the 
            beach rental job. For this, I am in charge of taking all reservations and keeping track of the database, including delivery off all customer 
            orders. I also lead marketing which includes our social media presence as well as “on the ground” efforts. Since I began 
            this role, we have grown 700% and I am the sole employee of this company.

      <h3>Technical Experience</h3><br>

        <div class="col p-col">
          <p>
            My technical experience includes online courses and project creation
            (such as this website) to further my skills. Two summers ago, I took a Coding with Mosh course on React Native, learning about mobile app development.
            I will be furthering that this semester through my Capstone project, building a mobile app for a local medical care and preventative education company.
            I've also worked with some React.js and Solidity - a blockchain smart contract coding language - outside of class.
            I enjoy spending my free time on personal projects that expand my knowledge and help me continue to learn. I believe a lot of learning is done outside of the classroom.
