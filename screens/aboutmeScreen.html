            <div class="paragraph"><p>My name is Timothy Markfeld and I am currently a Junior at the University of Alabama. I am simultaneously pursuing
                my bachelor's and master's degrees in Management Information Systems and will be graduating in May 2023. I'm seeking a job with 
                interests in software development and cybersecurity. </p>
                <p>For the past six summers, I have worked for Corolla Beach Rentals. I am responsible for leading a team during setup and takedown of
                  equipment.  I provide training and development for new hires.  I oversee the reservation systems which include online, telephone, and 
                  in person options.  I lead several operations areas of the company including equipment inventory and repair, as well as supply chain 
                  to ensure we are operating at peak performance. Through this job, I have learned a lot about interacting with customers and
                  working on/leading a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the past three summers, I have also been the General Manager of a new company, Corolla Ice Delivery. I do this simultaneously with the 
                  beach rental job. For this, I am in charge of taking all reservations and keeping track of the database, including delivery off all customer 
                  orders. On top of all this, I also lead marketing which includes our social media presence as well as “on the ground” efforts. Since I began 
                  this role, we have grown 700% and I am the sole worker of this company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My technical experience includes online courses and project creation (such as this website) to further my skills. This semester, 
                  I will be taking a Udemy course on React.js along 
                  with learning Solidity - the smart contract language for blockchain development - doing this on top of my school work. Last summer,
                  I took a Coding with Mosh course on React Native, learning about mobile app development.
